CONFIG_RFKILL
-------------
 -> Networking Support

 A method of disabling or enabling wifi radios. If it's not included the WiFi will throw an error while
 configuring it through `setup-interfaces`:

 Successfully initialized wpa_supplicant
 rfkill: Cannot open RFKILL control device

 The Wifi does function regardless of this error though, so long as wpa_supplicant is running (i.e. it
 might fail ar DHCP during boot if it starts before wpa_supplicant does, but should get get an IP okay
 soon after boot or from a manual `ifconfig wlan0 up`). This behaviour is consistent with that when
 RFKILL is enabled.


CONFIG_CAN
----------
 -> Networking Support
 
 A CAN bus may not be needed for the OPiZero itself to work so it could be removed from a minimal build.
 
 There is an actual CAN bus controller on board though, I believe with hardware specific options in:
 -> Networking support -> CAN bus subsystem support -> CAN Device Drivers


CONFIG_IKCONFIG
---------------
 -> General Setup -> Kernel .config support
 
 We don't need to store the config in the kernel in a minimal build.
 

CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_DW
---------------------
 -> Device Drivers -> Character devices -> Serial drivers

 This is required for the serial console.


CONFIG_SERIAL_DEV_BUS
---------------------
 Device Drivers -> Character devices
 
 Needs to be enabled to enable specific GNSS device support.
 
 
CONFIG_SERIAL_DEV_CTRL_TTYPORT
------------------------------

 Presumably should be enabled.
 
 
CONFIG_GNSS_UBX_SERIAL
-----------------------

 Device Drivers -> GNSS reciever suppor
 
 Support for u-blox chips.
 
CONFIG_PPS
----------
 -> Device Drivers
 
 Required for PPS signal from GPS.


CONFIG_NTP_PPS
CONFIG_PPS_CLIENT_KTIMER
CONFIG_PPS_CLIENT_GPIO
-----------------------
 -> Device Drivers -> PPS support
 
 Required for PPS signal from GPS.


CONFIG_PPS_CLIENT_LDISC
------------------------
 -> Device Drivers -> PPS support
 
 This is probably needed to make gpsd and chrony talk to each other.
 

CONFIG_SYSVIPC
--------------
 -> General Setup

 Chrony requires this to set up SHM to talk to gpsd.
